            <h3>Work Experience</h3>
            <p>I have spent 2 years- a large chunk of my college days- working as a tier two tech support Technician at Iskon Inhernet, receving tickets from customer support and resolving issues such as DLS down, low bandwidth, IPTV streaming problems, phone call routing and so on. IT was an interesting experience but did not offer a lot of space for growth.</p>
            <p>After finishing my Bachelors Degree, I started working as a Linux Support Technician at Touch Support, and I have been at this positon for almost 2 years We work with Liquid Web, one of the world's largest hosting companies, and provide support for our customers. My daily work consists of answering customer calls and tickets, connecting to our servers, investigating and resolving issues with mostly Magento And Wordpress platforms.</p>

                <p>I am a woman of many hobbies!</p>
                <p>Gaming is something I've been doing ever since the age of four or five when I was first introduced to some ye olde DOS games such as The Lost Vikings and Prehistorik. Noweadays I have more games on my STEAM account than I know what to do with.
                    By far my most expensive hobby is my LEGO obsession, which I've had ever since I was a child. My collection, which you can check out on BRICKSET is certainly not the biggest out there, but I'm quite fond of it.
                    There's also anime, though nowadays I would call myself a weaboo in recovery- long gone are the days when I used to watch ten to fifteen shows every season, nowadays I barely watch that much in a year. Still, I have accumulated quite a list of completed titles, as you can see on my ANILIST.
                    However, another old hobby that I have recently returned to is reading, mostly graphic novels and an occasional sci-fi book, as you can check out on my GOOODREADS profile.</p>

                <p>There's also a whole lot of other things such as 3D modeling, hiking, baking, collecting HotWheels and so on, but we'll leave those for some other time.</p>
